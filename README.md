Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions

Project Overview:-

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. 
The objective is to help financial institutions prevent financial losses caused by fraudulent activities by identifying suspicious transactions in real-time or near-real-time.

Problem Statement:-

Financial institutions are dealing with an increasing number of fraudulent credit card transactions, leading to significant financial losses. The goal is to develop a robust fraud detection system that accurately identifies and prevents fraudulent activities.


Objectives:-

Analyze historical transaction data to understand fraud patterns.
Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.
Implement a real-time or near-real-time fraud detection system.
Minimize false positives and false negatives to maintain model accuracy.
Data

The dataset contains transaction records from credit card holders. Each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate.

Key features include:-

Transaction amount
Cardholder information (anonymized)
Transaction location
Time of transaction
Type of merchant
Fraud status (fraud/non-fraud)


Key Tasks:-

Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and relationships in the transaction data.
Data Preprocessing: Handle imbalanced data, missing values, and perform feature scaling/encoding.
Model Development: Implement machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance on test data using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Real-time Implementation: Design and implement the model into a real-time fraud detection system.


Methodology:-

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigate patterns in fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.
Data Preprocessing:
Handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.
Perform feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical ones.
Model Development: Train multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to detect fraud.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC-AUC curve.
Real-time Integration: Implement the model for real-time fraud detection, ensuring low latency and scalability.
